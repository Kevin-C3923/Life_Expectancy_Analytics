# Life_Expectancy_Analytics




## Machine Learning Model
Our machine learning model will help us find strong or weak correlation to lifespan.Since our datasets are labeled and we are looking for a linear regression correlation we will use a supervised machine learning model and or a deep learning.
It is expected to use the SciKit-Learn library for this model,however this aspect is pending final design.

### Output label- Lifespan/# of death
### Input label- % Fair or Poor Health; % Low birthweight; Food Environment Index; # Driving Deaths;# Uninsured; Mental Health Provider Ratio

### ETL for Datasets
